## How to read

Each gap has an ID (DG-01…), the table(s) affected, the current state, the root cause, the
consequence for research/backtesting, the status, and the next step. "Accepted" means the gap is
known and deliberately not fixed (hardware limit, no free source, or design choice) — it stays on
the list so nobody assumes it was overlooked.

---

## Open gaps — prioritised

### DG-01 — India historical index membership (the biggest open gap)

**Tables:** `universe_constituents` (NIFTY500 / NIFTYMICROCAP250), `index_membership` (India slice missing)

**State:** US side is complete — `membership_history.py` rebuilds point-in-time S&P 500 intervals from
Wikipedia's constituents + changes tables (891 intervals, drift 0, comprehensive ~2012→, selected
to 1976). India side does not exist.

**Root cause:** NSE reconstitution circulars are unstructured PDFs scattered across press pages.
No bulk machine-readable source identified (ADR 0025 evaluated S&P DJI press releases, CRSP/
Compustat (paid), scraping — all rejected or unaffordable for a homelab).

**Consequence:** India backtests (EV-0-style signal testing) suffer survivorship bias — identical to
the US problem before EV-1. `universe_membership_snapshots` accrues forward from 2026-10-18 only,
so the India *past* cannot be reconstructed.

**Status:** 🔶 Open — ~1 session for India (NSE PDF parsing). Tracked in `pending-tasks.md` §1
project row ("EV-1 historical index membership — India half deferred").

**Source:** `docs/adr/0025-historical-index-membership-from-wikipedia.md`,
`docs/pending-tasks.md` §1 project table.

---

### DG-02 — FII/DII history — forward-only

**Table:** `capital_flows` (FII/DII)

**State:** Starts 2026-09-29 and accrues daily. NSE's `fiidiiTradeReact` API serves exactly one day
(probed live 2026-10-20). No official NSE bulk archive exists.

**Alternatives considered:** third-party aggregator day-by-day pages (Stockezee/Upstox, no CSV)
and a static 2018–24 research dataset (Mendeley). Neither adopted.

**Consequence:** No historical FII/DII flow backtests possible until a source is adopted or forward
history accumulates over years.

**Status:** 🤔 Owner decision — accept forward-only (like news), or adopt a third-party source with
quality/terms caveats.

**Source:** `docs/pending-tasks.md` H-6; `docs/market-data-architecture.md` §4.3a ("partly — NSE
archive depth unverified").

---

### DG-03 — India NSE fundamentals backfill incomplete (~100 symbols + 13 dead URLs)

**Table:** `financial_facts` (source `nse_cons` / `nse_sa`), `stock_fundamentals`

**State:** `nse_fundamentals.py` backfill ran 2026-10-18→19 (357/495 symbols, 24,662 filings,
153,978 rows), hit `MAX_MINUTES` with cursor kept, resumed on RVNL.NS. ~100 symbols remain.

**Dead NSE archive URLs (~13 symbols):** HEGAM, COFORGE, ARE&M, KPIL, CEMPRO — return 404 on
NSE's side, logged WARN, skipped.

**Consequence:** India fundamentals coverage incomplete until backfill completes (`cursor cleared`);
`nse-fundamentals` CronJob stays suspended until then; India fundamental screens can't be trusted
until the DRY_RUN diff vs yfinance passes.

**Status:** 🔶 In flight — run to `cursor cleared`, then (1) un-suspend `nse-fundamentals`, (2)
screener DRY_RUN diff for NIFTY top-50, (3) re-run EV-0 with India fundamentals, (4) update the
coverage row in `architecture.md` §4.3a.

**Source:** `docs/pending-tasks.md` G-6 history backfills; `manifests/stock-screener/scripts/nse_fundamentals.py`.

---

### DG-04 — No per-stock second price source

**Table:** `stock_prices` (validation), DQ-5 `accuracy-check`

**State:** Stooq grew a JS challenge wall in Oct 2026 — the original per-stock second source for
check D is dead. FRED `SP500` index-level check exists (validates ^GSPC closes, 10/10 within 0.5%),
but there is **no per-stock independent price source**. FMP free tier for US fundamentals depth is
schema-ready (`source` keying) but deferred.

**Consequence:** DQ-5 can cross-check the index level vs FRED, but not individual stock prices.

**Status:** 🤔 Owner choice — free API key (Finnhub/Tiingo) needed for per-stock second source.

**Source:** `manifests/stock-screener/scripts/accuracy_check.py` (check D comment),
`docs/pending-tasks.md` §1 (Stooq wall + FRED benchmark check live),
`docs/stock-screener-implementation-plan.md` §16 (FMP deferred).

---

### DG-05 — Multibagger screen backtest — Nifty impossible, S&P possible

**Tables:** `stock_prices`, `stock_fundamentals`, `financial_facts`

**State:** Nifty 500 has only ~4 annual Yahoo points per company with **no filing dates** — cannot
backtest point-in-time fundamental screens. S&P 500 has EDGAR history with filing dates since 2007
(~60 periods per symbol), so multibagger-style screens *can* be backtested there.

**Consequence:** Any India fundamental backtest (post-earnings drift EV-15 for India, etc.) is L
effort / blocked until NSE quarterly results feed with filing dates exists.

**Status:** 🔶 Structural — Nifty side blocked; S&P side testable today.

**Source:** `docs/evidence-based-signals-roadmap.md` Phase 2 (EV-15: India = L / US = M).

---

### DG-06 — Intraday coverage — 4 tickers only, ~2 years max

**Table:** `intraday_prices`

**State:** Holds 4 tickers since 2026-10-01. Yahoo keeps hourly bars ~2 years.

**Consequence:** Sparse intraday history, few symbols.

**Status:** 🔶 Tier-1 quick-win project — one-list change in `intraday-fetcher` to add ^GSPC, ^NSEI
etc.; not done.

**Source:** `docs/market-data-architecture.md` §4.3a; `docs/market-data-finds-and-projects.md` Tier 1 #5.

---

### DG-07 — `stock_metrics` not yet computed on `adj_close`

**Tables:** `stock_metrics_daily`, `stock_prices` (has own `adj_close`)

**State:** EV-0 showed small rank effects. Metrics still computed on raw close; switching to the
own total-return `adj_close` (ADR 0014, recomputed per symbol, 0 NULL of 6.34M rows) is a separate
decision not yet made.

**Consequence:** Momentum/volatility scores may be slightly distorted by unadjusted corporate
actions.

**Status:** 🤔 Downstream EV-0 decision; small effect.

**Source:** `docs/pending-tasks.md` DQ-1 downstream note; `docs/adr/0014-own-total-return-adj-close.md`.

---

### DG-08 — `mdjob` / `job_runs` — single adopter

**Tables:** `job_runs`, `pipeline_heartbeat`

**State:** `job_runs` table + `manifests/_common/mdjob.py` helper exist (ADR 2 / AR-3 groundwork).
`factors-fetcher:v1` is the first adopter (first `job_runs` row: ok/7674). No other image uses it
yet. Grafana stale-feed rule can't read `job_runs` until adoption spreads.

**Consequence:** No durable per-job run record except `pipeline_heartbeat` (10 feeds, checked
01:45 UTC).

**Status:** 🔄 Adopt per image at each natural rebuild; then Grafana can read `job_runs`.

**Source:** `docs/pending-tasks.md` AR-2/AR-3 follow-ups; `manifests/_common/mdjob.py`.

---

### DG-09 — Nifty Auto / FMCG index dead on Yahoo

**Table:** `index_prices`

**State:** ^CNXAUTO / ^CNXFMCG / NIFTYAUTO.NS / NIFTYFMCG.NS are current-quote ghosts only (no
history). Nifty 500 restored via ^CRSLDX.

**Consequence:** No Auto/FMCG index price history in the pipeline.

**Status:** 🔶 NSE direct (session-cookie API like fiidii) or jugaad-data needed; not built.

**Source:** `docs/market-data-pipeline-operations-manual.md` §12 item 2;
`docs/market-data-finds-and-projects.md` Tier 2 #9, F11.

---

### DG-10 — `news_sentiment` / `raw_headlines` — no unique constraints

**Tables:** `news_sentiment`, `raw_headlines`

**State:** `11-news-constraints.sql` exists but unique constraints not applied (ops manual §12 item 5).
INSERT-only writers today.

**Consequence:** Duplicate headlines possible on re-run (24 same-headline pairs on different days
are feed republications and intentionally kept).

**Status:** 🔶 Needs `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` in scorer/fetcher at next image rebuild.

**Source:** `docs/market-data-pipeline-operations-manual.md` §12 item 5.

---

### DG-11 — Gross profit sparse on EDGAR

**Table:** `financial_facts` (EDGAR leg), `EDGAR_MAP`

**State:** Many EDGAR filers skip the `GrossProfit` tag. Revenue−COGS derivation is an option if
EV-10 (gross profitability) needs more coverage.

**Consequence:** Gross profitability factor (EV-10) has incomplete US coverage.

**Status:** 🔶 Known limitation — noted in `EDGAR_MAP` extension; derivation is a future option.

**Source:** `docs/evidence-based-signals-roadmap.md` EV-9 note;
`manifests/stock-screener/scripts/stock_fundamentals.py` (EDGAR_MAP comments).

---

## Accepted gaps (by design — recorded so they are not forgotten)

### DG-12 — India G-Sec / repo rate history — forward-only

**Tables:** `interest_rates`, `bond_yields`

**State:** `rbi-fetcher` scrapes RBI's mobile "Current Rates" widget (current only, as-on T-1).
No stable machine-readable historical source for India G-Sec yields or repo rate history.

**Consequence:** India rates forward-only from 2026-10-09; US DFF holds 1954+.

**Status:** ✅ Accepted as closed gap (ops manual §12 item 1) — no source found.

**Source:** `docs/market-data-pipeline-operations-manual.md` §12 item 1;
`docs/market-data-architecture.md` §4.3a.

---

### DG-13 — FDI flows — manual quarterly INSERT by design

**Table:** (none dedicated — manual INSERT)

**State:** DPIIT FDI factsheets are PDFs. `fdi-watch` logs DPIIT links monthly → 5-min manual INSERT.

**Consequence:** FDI data sparse, manual, current-only.

**Status:** 🧊 Accepted by design — watchdog + quarterly manual INSERT.

**Source:** `docs/market-data-finds-and-projects.md` F14.

---

### DG-14 — US TIC mirror stat — deferred

**Table:** (none)

**State:** Listed in `architecture.md` as deferred; no fetcher or manifest references it.

**Consequence:** No Treasury International Capital data.

**Status:** 🤔 Deferred — no source identified.

**Source:** `docs/market-data-architecture.md` line 282.

---

### DG-15 — News / sentiment history — no backfill possible

**Tables:** `raw_headlines`, `news_sentiment`, `headline_entities`, `headline_events`

**State:** All start 2026-09-29 (pipeline go-live). RSS serves current items only. Moneycontrol ×2
and Reuters feeds died Oct 2026, replaced with LiveMint, BusinessLine, CNBC, MarketWatch — source
mix changed at that boundary, affecting sentiment comparability.

**Consequence:** No historical news backtests; sentiment has ~2-4 weeks of history.

**Status:** 🧊 Structural — forward-only.

**Source:** `docs/market-data-architecture.md` §4.3a;
`docs/market-data-finds-and-projects.md` F13.

---

### DG-16 — `commodity_prices` table — empty by design

**Table:** `commodity_prices`

**State:** Commodities (GC=F, SI=F, CL=F) ride in `index_prices` via the yfinance batch.
`commodity_prices` hypertable exists but is empty.

**Consequence:** No separate commodity pipeline; commodity data only as index tickers.

**Status:** ✅ Accepted by design.

**Source:** `docs/market-data-architecture.md` §4.3a; `docs/market-data-finds-and-projects.md` F15.

---

### DG-17 — India yfinance fundamentals — ~4 annual points, no filing dates

**Tables:** `stock_fundamentals` (India yfinance leg), `financial_facts` (yfinance values)

**State:** `stock_fundamentals.py` falls back to yfinance for India (no CIK). ~4 annual statements
per company, no filing dates.

**Consequence:** Point-in-time India fundamental signals cannot be built from Yahoo; require NSE
filings (G-6, DG-03).

**Status:** 🧊 Accepted — Yahoo limit.

**Source:** `docs/market-data-architecture.md` §4.3a.

---

### DG-18 — `universe_membership_snapshots` — no past

**Table:** `universe_membership_snapshots`

**State:** Appended weekly by `universe_refresh.py` (G-2a) from 2026-10-18 only. The past needs
EV-1 (historical index changes), which exists for US SP500 but not India (DG-01).

**Consequence:** Survivorship-free India backtests impossible until India EV-1 equivalent exists.

**Status:** 🔶 Blocked on DG-01 (India historical membership).

**Source:** `docs/market-data-architecture.md` §4.3a;
`docs/evidence-based-signals-roadmap.md` standing limitation.

---

### DG-19 — TX2 ML capacity ceiling — hardware limit

**Component:** TX2 (Pascal sm_62, CUDA 10.2, JetPack 4.6.1)

**State:** Modern PyTorch cannot use the GPU. Options: old L4T-era torch (1.10–1.12) or TensorRT
8.2.1 with ONNX. CPU-side modern torch works (2.14). JetPack 5 reflash is icebox.

**Consequence:** ML training/inference limited to CPU on TX2; RTX 3090 AI layer is a separate
Tier-3 project.

**Status:** 🧊 Icebox — hardware ceiling, not a code gap.

**Source:** `docs/market-data-finds-and-projects.md` §1.4.
