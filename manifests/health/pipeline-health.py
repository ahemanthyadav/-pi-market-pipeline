"""Pipeline health monitor (heartbeat v1).

Checks per-feed data freshness in the live DB and upserts one row per feed
into pipeline_heartbeat. A missed CronJob, dead upstream, or broken write
path all show up as stale last_data_ts -> fresh=false (Grafana/alertable).

v1 semantics (feed freshness, written by this job at 01:45 UTC):
  last_check    = when this check ran
  last_data_ts  = max(ts) of the feed's data
  fresh         = age(last_data_ts) <= max_age_hours
  rows_total    = total rows in the feed's table

v2 (per-JOB last_ok written by each fetcher) lands with the next fetcher
image rebuilds. Exit code is 0 even with stale feeds (staleness is DATA,
visible via the table); nonzero only if the DB itself is unreachable.
