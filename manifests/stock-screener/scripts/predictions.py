"""Prediction scorecard (prediction-validation plan, schema 18) — daily job.

Two passes in one run:
1. SNAPSHOT: write today's claims write-once-per-day (DELETE+INSERT only
   today's rows): kind 'screener_rank' (value=rank, aux=composite) for every
   eligible scored symbol, and kind 'valuation_upside' (value=upside_pct,
   aux=fair_value) for every valued symbol. `close` stores the ADJUSTED close
   at snapshot so later returns are total-return and split-safe.
2. RESOLVE: for every snapshot whose horizon (30/91/182 calendar days) has
   elapsed and that has no outcome row yet, compute the realized adjusted
   forward return and the universe benchmark's return over the same window,
   then INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING (outcomes are write-once).

Prices: stock_prices.adj_close at the latest bar <= the target date (markets
close on weekends; the nearest prior bar is the correct fill). Benchmarks:
index_prices close for ^GSPC / ^CRSLDX (no adjusted series; index levels).
Scheduled after stock-screener (02:15) and stock-valuation (02:10).
