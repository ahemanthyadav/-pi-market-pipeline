"""DQ-5 accuracy cross-checks (weekly) — is the data right, independently?

Five checks, one markdown report written to stock_reports as '__accuracy__'
(DELETE+INSERT of its own (symbol, ts) row — rule 4):
  A. stock_valuations internals recomputed in SQL: fair_value == median of
     the 8 method columns, upside_pct == (fair/close - 1) * 100.
  B. sector_metrics.median_pe recomputed with percentile_cont over members.
  C. index_membership current S&P set vs universe_constituents (drift count).
  D. SECOND SOURCE: a deterministic weekly rotation of 25 SP500 symbols,
     our stock_prices.close vs Stooq's free CSV on the matched date;
     flag |diff| > 0.5% (NSE skipped: Stooq's .in coverage is unreliable).
  E. Freshness of the tables every page/report reads.

A failed check is reported, not fatal: the job exits 0 and the report (and
its WARN lines in the log) carry the findings. Alerting on it stays with the
daily digest's stale-feeds pattern if it ever matters enough.
